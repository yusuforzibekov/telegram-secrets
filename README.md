To change the incoming message or call sound in Telegram Desktop, follow these steps:

1. Download the desired sound and save it in a folder, for example, C:\Music\MySound.mp3.

2. Open Telegram Desktop and make sure you are using the English layout.

3. Open Settings.

4. Type "`msg_incoming`" on your keyboard for changing the incoming message sound or "`call_incoming`" for changing the incoming call sound. You won't see this text anywhere, but keep typing as if it is a cheat code in a game. Don't forget the underscore.

5. If you typed "`msg_incoming`" correctly, a dialog window will appear, asking you to open an mp3 file. If you typed "`call_incoming`" correctly, the app will play the current incoming call sound.

6. Navigate to the folder where you saved the sound (C:\Music) and double-click on MySound.mp3.

7. If you're changing the incoming message sound, close Telegram Desktop completely (Ctrl+Q by default) and open it again. If you're changing the incoming call sound, the new sound will be applied immediately.

8. Done! The incoming message/call sound has been changed. If you want to revert back to the original sounds, type "`sounds_reset`" command in Settings and restart the app.
